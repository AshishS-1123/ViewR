# ViewR

*This is a really small GTK3 Application I developed to make my life easier.*

Let's say you have a design website that you want to convert to a responsive HTML and CSS website. Since this image is in PNG/JPG format, you need a way to measure distances between various elements, get the colors, etc. There are many tools out there that will help you do all this, but I find it annoying that there is no app I can install tailored for just this purpose.

Using **ViewR** you will be able to import images, draw guidelines, find values of colors using color picker, etc.
I will try to release a design and roadmap soon.
